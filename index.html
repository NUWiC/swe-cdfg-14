        original lyrics here...
        http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/spicegirls/wannabe.html
       
        If you want my future forget my past, <br>
If you wanna get with me better make it fast, <br>
Now don't go wasting my precious time, <br>
Get your act together we could be just fine <br>
<br>

I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want, <br>
So tell me what you want, what you really really want, <br>
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, <br>
I wanna really really really wanna zigazig ha. <br>
<br>
If you wanna be my lover, <br>
you gotta get with my friends (gotta get with my friends) <br>
Make it last forever friendship never ends, <br>
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give, <br>
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is. <br>
<br>
...
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try <br>
If you really bug me then I'll say goodbye. <br>
<br>        
So here's a story from A to Z, you wanna get with me you gotta listen carefully...<br>

[First Rap: T.I.]
Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league
  To shoot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
// Please!

We like dem boys that:
  be in them lac's leanin'
  Open their mouth their grill gleamin'
  Candy paint, keep that whip clean and
  They always be talkin that country slang we like
  They keep that beat that be in the back beatin'
  Eyes be so low from that chief
A rude boy && that's good to me, && wit street credibility

If your status ain't hood
  I ain't checkin' for him → return false
If (he’s ! street) // Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
  (That ain't scared to stand up for me) OR
  (Known to carry big things)  // If you know what I mean OR
(Gotta know to get dough && he betta be street)

[Second Rap: Lil Wayne]
If you don't see me on the block
  I ain't tryna hide
  I blend in wit the hood, i'm camouflage

If (you want me)
  there's no discount price tonight / But I don't need your dollar bills I just want something real / Cause, nothing's free, except a lovin' me

If (you wanna ride), 
  just name your price
  don't play cheap, with your heart
if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
  Don't make a bet
// Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
